I'm a Master student, currently studying at the [University of Trento (Italy)](http://www.unitn.it/en). 
I have studied at the [TU Kaiserslautern (Germany)](http://www.uni-kl.de/5098.html?L=1)
 and the [RWTH Aachen (Germany)](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bdz/) before.
 
 I started Computer Science because I wanted to know how computers work. I found it fascinating that humans
 were able to build a "universal" machine that can basically do anything (later I learned that this is not
 true ;)).
 
The topics I am interested in vary greatly. In these times, new technologies and opportunities grow
so fast that it is hard to follow them all.

However if had to name some of my areas of interest, it would probably come down to
 
 - Web technologies
 - Algorithms
 - Machine Learning
 - Computer Security
 
 
I know I cannot know everything, but I am trying to learn a bit more every day.

Some of my favorite quotes:

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." (Antoine de Saint Exupery)

> "If you're not making mistakes, you're not doing anything." (John Wooden)
