I studied computer science at the [RWTH Aachen (Germany)](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/bdz/), 
[University of Trento (Italy)](http://www.unitn.it/en) and the [TU Kaiserslautern (Germany)](http://www.uni-kl.de/5098.html?L=1).
Now I am a doctoral fellow at the [National Research Centre for Geomputation](http://ncg.nuim.ie/) in Ireland.

I started to be interested computer science because I wanted to know how computers work. I found it fascinating that humans
 were able to build a "universal" machine that can basically do anything (later I learned that this is not
 true ;)).
 
The topics I am interested in vary greatly. In these times, new technologies and opportunities grow
so fast that it is hard to follow them all.

However if had to name some of my areas of interest, it would probably come down to
 
 - Web technologies
 - Algorithms
 - Machine Learning
 - Computer Security

thought that does not mean that I am very familiar with all of these topics.

I am an avid programmer and active user on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).
 
I know I cannot know everything, but I am trying to learn a bit more every day.
