Chromepad is an extension for Google Chrome which lets you easily submit code to [codepad.org](http://codepad.org) and 
display the results, without having to leave the current site. 
It provides syntax highlighting and keeps a history of your code snippets.

**Note:** Chromepad is not officially avaiable on the Web Store yet. Still, you can download the packaged application from my dropbox account.
