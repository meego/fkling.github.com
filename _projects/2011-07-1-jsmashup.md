JSMashup is a protoypal JavaScript library for managing and executing mashup compositions. It was created as part of my Master thesis and is used
by [ResEval Mash](http://open.reseval.org/), a mashup development environment, also developed by me. This website features a video of the application, which is worth watching. 

The source code for JSMashup is available, but documentation and examples are not compelted yet.
